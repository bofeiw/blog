# Weekly Summary

This is my all new weekly summary, a place where I will summarise what I did for the past week and the future plan for the next week.

I try to make what I did and am doing as transparent as possible to improve my efficiency and decrease procrastination. Because you can find and compare what are scheduled in week `n` but aren't done in week `n+1` and laugh at me (hahahaha I know you will). The complete change log is at https://github.com/bofeiw/blog/commits/master so all changes are reserved.
