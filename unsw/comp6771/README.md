# C++
C++ is backwards compatible with C, however, while valid C code is often valid C++, good C is is almost never good C++ code, and C++ continues to diverge from C.

# Notes
For Mac users who can not run the `chmod` to set up environment on your own machine, try this line:
```text
chmod a+x ~/Library/Application\ Support/CLion2019.*/clwb/gdb/gdbserver
```
Note to replace `*` to your actual CLion version. This works for me (macOS Catalina) because the CLion plugin path is [different](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23141889/9494810) from the provided path.
