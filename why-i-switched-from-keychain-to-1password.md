# Why I Switched from Keychain to 1Password

[iCloud Keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(software\)), the password manager of Apple platform, is a good product and I was a deep user of it since iPhone 5s (Almost 6 years). Recently I decided to move to 1Password. Here are the whys.

## Cross platform

Keychain is designed to service Apple products, and is enclosed to Apple ecosystem only. I was a deep user of Apple since iPhone 5s, and almost all devices since that time were Apple (iPhones, iPods, Macs, iPads, Watches, etc...). Keychain provides a smooth user experience within Apple's products, and integrates with Touch ID, Face ID nicely. However the fatal problem is that it only supports Apple's own products, but none of non-Apple products. So I have to find the password on one of the Apple products and input it again when log in from another non-Apple device (any Windows, Linux, Android devices), or even another non-Safari browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc...). This is extremely annoying when you are not only using Apple products. I sometimes use Linux and Windows, and this is the main reason that driven me to switch to another password manager.

So 1Password is my choice. It is cross platform, and it supports all browsers including Safari. It means it's compatible with more products (imagine what 1Password supports is a superset of what Keychain supports), which is very important.

## Notes

Keychain supports secure notes, but only on macOS, which means you cannot edit or even view the notes on mobile or any other non-macOS devices. However 1Password offers the option to view and edit all notes anywhere.

## Security

"1Password has never been hacked." I saw this on 1Password website. They are confident to advertise this, and I believe their security is fine. Keychain also should be fine, so security is not a big issue to worry about.

## Command line tool

1Password offers a [command line tool](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/), which is good for developers. Although I haven't tried it out, but they have this option where Keychain does not.
